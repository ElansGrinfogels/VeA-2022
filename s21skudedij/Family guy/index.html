                <p><em>Family Guy</em> is an American adult animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company.</p>
                <p>Family Guy is an American adult animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series centers on the Griffins, a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children, Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog, Brian. Set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, the show exhibits much of its humor in the form of metafictional cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.</p>
                <p>In short, Family Guy is only available via Disney Plus if you live in one of the countries where Star is included in your Disney Plus subscription. That means countries like the U.K., Australia, and Canada have Family Guy on Disney Plus but the U.S. misses out.</p>
                <p>This show is pretty funny, but you should not show it to your kids if they are under 13. There is violence, sex, and other stuff</p>
