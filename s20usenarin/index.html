                    <p>Vex was born and raised in Bandle City Crest icon.png Bandle City, and despite her parents' best efforts, Vex never felt like she belonged. She disliked the city's bright colors and she could never really find her "yordle spirit" or any like-minded friends. She spent most of her time sulking in her room, spending time with her shadow, which she liked because it was dark and never said anything.</p>

                    <p>Once ruler of a long-lost kingdom, Viego Viego perished over a thousand years ago when his attempt to bring his wife wife back from the dead triggered the magical catastrophe known as the Ruination. Transformed into a powerful, unliving wraith tortured by an obsessive longing for his centuries-dead queen, Viego now stands as the Ruined King, controlling the deadly Harrowings as he scours Runeterra Crest icon.png Runeterra for anything that might one day restore her, and destroying all in his path as the Black Mist pours endlessly from his cruel, broken heart.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Maokai is a rageful, towering treant who fights the unnatural horrors of the Shadow Isles Crest icon.png Shadow Isles. He was twisted into a force of vengeance after a magical cataclysm destroyed his home, surviving undeath only through the waters of life infused within his heartwood. Once a peaceful nature spirit, Maokai now furiously battles to banish the scourge of unlife from the Shadow Isles and restore his home to its former beauty.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Sadistic and cunning, Thresh is an ambitious and restless spirit of the Shadow Isles. Once the custodian of countless arcane secrets, he was undone by a power greater than life or death, and now sustains himself by tormenting and breaking others with slow, excruciating inventiveness. His victims suffer far beyond their brief mortal coil as Thresh wreaks agony upon their souls, imprisoning them in his unholy lantern to torture for all eternity.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Hecarim is a spectral fusion of man and beast, cursed to ride down the souls of the living for all eternity. When the Blessed Isles fell into shadow, this proud knight was undone by the destructive energies of the Ruination, along with all his cavalry and their mounts. Now, whenever the Black Mist reaches out across Runeterra, he leads their devastating charge, reveling in the slaughter and crushing foes beneath his armored hooves.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>The last survivor of a long-forgotten religious order, Yorick Yorick is both blessed and cursed with power over the dead. Trapped on the Shadow Isles Crest icon.png Shadow Isles, his only companions are the rotting corpses and shrieking spirits that he gathers to him. Yorick's monstrous actions belie his noble purpose: to free his home from the curse of the Ruination.</p>
